National Cyber Security Awareness Month (NCSAM) is observed in October in the United States of America. Started by the National Cyber Security Division within the Department of Homeland Security and the nonprofit National Cyber Security Alliance, the month raises awareness about the importance of cybersecurity.


== History ==
In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security and the National Cyber Security Alliance launched National Cyber Security Awareness Month as a broad effort to help Americans stay safe and secure online. Initial efforts included advice like keeping antivirus programs up to date. Since 2009, the month has included an overall theme, "Our Shared Responsibility," and weekly themes throughout the month were introduced in 2011. In October 2023, a new theme "Secure Our World" was announced as an enduring theme for future years.
