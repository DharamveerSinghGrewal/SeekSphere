Filecoin (⨎) is a cryptocurrency intended to be a blockchain-based cooperative digital storage and data retrieval method. It was developed by Protocol Labs and shares some ideas from InterPlanetary File System allowing users to rent unused hard drive space. Filecoin is an open protocol and uses a blockchain to record participation in the network. Transactions are made using the blockchain's currency, FIL. The blockchain is based on both proof of-replication and proof of space-time.


== History ==
The project was launched in August 2017, and raised over $200 million within 30 minutes via an initial coin offering.
In 2020, the project set up the Filecoin Foundation under the leadership of founding officer Megan Klimen to support the development of the protocol, and the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web to support other projects contributing to the ecosystem of the decentralized web.
Their Board of Directors and advisors include Brewster Kahle (Founder of Internet Archive), Joe Lubin (Founder of Consensys & Cofounder of Ethereum), and Denelle Dixon (CEO of Stellar Development Foundation).


== Philanthropy ==
In April 2021, the Filecoin Foundation donated 50,000 filecoins worth $10,000,000 to the Internet Archive. In addition, Internet Archive's founder Brewster Kahle and director of partnerships Wendy Hanamura joined the boards of advisors of Filecoin and the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web.


== Network total storage power ==
As of August 2024, the total storage capacity was 23 EiB, and total data stored was 2.0 EiB.
