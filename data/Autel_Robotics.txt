== History ==
Autel Robotics Co., Ltd. was founded in 2014 in Shenzhen by Maxwell Lee and Li Hongjing. Maxwell Lee is a Chinese American entrepreneur.
Autel Robotics has received government funding and support from the Chinese government. The company released its first drone called X-Star in 2015 in global markets and has other notable product lines, including the Evo and Dragon Fish series.
In 2021 Autel Robotics had a 7% share of the UAV market in the United States. Its market share increased after leading rival DJI was restricted by the US government. Along with DJI their drones have been widely acquired by US law enforcement and government agencies. Concerns have frequently been raised about potential risks associated with this use, but significant evidence of risk has not been presented and there is criticism of those concerns.
In 2023 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas Autel Robotics made its intention to surpass DJI in both technology and market share known.
