The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a set of voluntary guidelines designed to help organizations assess and improve their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cybersecurity risks. Developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the framework was initially published in 2014 for critical infrastructure sectors but has since been widely adopted across various industries, including government and private enterprises globally. The framework integrates existing standards, guidelines, and best practices to provide a structured approach to cybersecurity risk management.
The CSF is composed of three primary components: the Core, Implementation Tiers, and Profiles. The Core outlines five key cybersecurity functions—Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover—each of which is further divided into specific categories and subcategories. These functions offer a high-level, outcome-driven approach to managing cybersecurity risks. The Implementation Tiers help organizations assess the sophistication of their cybersecurity practices, while the Profiles allow for customization based on an organization's unique risk profile and needs.
Since its inception, the CSF has undergone several updates to reflect the evolving nature of cybersecurity. Version 1.1, released in 2018, introduced enhancements related to supply chain risk management and self-assessment processes. The most recent update, Version 2.0, was published in 2024, expanding the framework’s applicability and adding new guidance on cybersecurity governance and continuous improvement practices.
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is used internationally and has been translated into multiple languages. It serves as a benchmark for cybersecurity standards, helping organizations align their practices with recognized global standards, such as ISO/IEC 27001 and COBIT. While widely praised, the framework has been criticized for the cost and complexity involved in its implementation, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.


== Overview ==
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a set of guidelines developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to help organizations manage and mitigate cybersecurity risks. It draws from existing standards, guidelines, and best practices to provide a flexible and scalable approach to cybersecurity. The framework provides a high-level taxonomy of cybersecurity outcomes and offers a methodology for assessing and managing those outcomes. Additionally, it addresses the protection of privacy and civil liberties in a cybersecurity context. 
The CSF has been translated into multiple languages and is widely used by governments, businesses, and organizations across various sectors. According to a 2016 survey, 70% of organizations view the NIST Cybersecurity Framework as a best practice for computer security, though some have noted that implementation can require significant investment.
The framework is designed to be flexible and adaptable, providing high-level guidance that allows individual organizations to determine the specifics of implementation based on their unique needs and risk profiles.
Version 1.0 of the framework was published in 2014, primarily targeting operators of critical infrastructure. A public draft of Version 1.1 was released for comment in 2017, and the final version was published on April 16, 2018. Version 1.1 retained compatibility with the original framework while introducing additional guidance on areas such as supply chain risk management. Version 2.0, released in 2024, further expanded the framework's scope and introduced new guidelines on self-assessment and cybersecurity governance.
The framework consists of three main components: the "Core," "Profiles," and "Tiers." The Core provides a comprehensive set of activities, outcomes, and references related to various aspects of cybersecurity. The Implementation Tiers help organizations assess their cybersecurity practices and sophistication, while the Profiles allow organizations to tailor the framework to their specific requirements and risk assessments.
Organizations typically start by developing a "Current Profile" to describe their existing cybersecurity practices and outcomes. From there, they can create a "Target Profile" to outline the desired future state and define the steps needed to achieve it. Alternatively, organizations can adopt a baseline profile based on their sector or specific industry needs. 
Research indicates that the NIST Cybersecurity Framework has the potential to influence cybersecurity standards both within the United States and internationally, particularly in sectors where formal cybersecurity standards are still emerging. This influence could foster better international cybersecurity practices, benefiting businesses that operate across borders and contributing to global cybersecurity efforts.


== Functions and categories of cybersecurity activities ==

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework organizes its "core" material into five "functions" which are subdivided into a total of 23 "categories". For each category, it defines a number of subcategories of cybersecurity outcomes and security controls, with 108 subcategories in all.
For each subcategory, it also provides "Informative Resources" referencing specific sections of a variety of other information security standards, including ISO 27001, COBIT, NIST SP 800-53, ANSI/ISA-62443, and the Council on CyberSecurity Critical Security Controls (CCS CSC, now managed by the Center for Internet Security).  Special Publications (SP) aside, most of the informative references requires a paid membership or purchase to access their respective guides.  The cost and complexity of the framework has resulted in bills from both houses of Congress that direct NIST to create Cybersecurity Framework guides that are more accessible to small and medium businesses.
Here are the functions and categories, along with their unique identifiers and definitions, as stated in the framework document.


=== Identify ===
"Develop the organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities."

Asset Management (ID.AM): The data, personnel, devices, systems, and facilities that enable the organization to achieve business purposes are identified and managed consistent with their relative importance to business objectives and the organization's risk strategy.
Business Environment (ID.BE): The organization's mission, objectives, stakeholders, and activities are understood and prioritized; this information is used to inform cybersecurity roles, responsibilities, and risk management decisions.
Governance (ID.GV):- The policies, procedures, and processes to manage and monitor the organization's regulatory, legal, risk, environmental, and operational requirements are understood and inform the management of cybersecurity risk.
Risk Assessment (ID.RA): The organization understands the cybersecurity risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, and individuals.
Risk Management Strategy (ID.RM): The organization's priorities, constraints, risk tolerances, and assumptions are established and used to support operational risk decisions.
Supply Chain Risk Management (ID.SC): The organization's priorities, constraints, risk tolerances, and assumptions are established and used to support risk decisions associated with managing supply chain risk. The organization has in place the processes to identify, assess and manage supply chain risks.


=== Protect ===
"Develop and implement the appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical infrastructure services."

Access Control (PR.AC): Access to assets and associated facilities is limited to authorized users, processes, or devices, and to authorized activities and transactions.
Awareness and Training (PR.AT): The organization's personnel and partners are provided cybersecurity awareness education and are adequately trained to perform their information security-related duties and responsibilities consistent with related policies, procedures, and agreements.
Data Security (PR.DS): Information and records (data) are managed consistent  with the organization's risk strategy to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.
Information Protection Processes and Procedures (PR.IP): Security policies (that address purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, and coordination among organizational entities), processes, and procedures are maintained and used to manage protection of information systems and assets.
Maintenance (PR.MA): Maintenance and repairs of industrial control and information system components is performed consistent with policies and procedures.
Protective Technology (PR.PT): Technical security solutions are managed to ensure the security and resilience of systems and assets, consistent with related policies, procedures, and agreements.


=== Detect ===
"Develop and implement the appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event."

Anomalies and Events (DE.AE): Anomalous activity is detected in a timely manner and the potential impact of events is understood.
Security Continuous Monitoring (DE.CM): The information system and assets are monitored at discrete intervals to identify cybersecurity events and verify the effectiveness of protective measures.
Detection Processes (DE.DP): Detection processes and procedures are maintained and tested to ensure timely and adequate awareness of anomalous events.


=== Respond ===
"Develop and implement the appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident."

Response Planning (RS.RP): Response processes and procedures are executed and maintained, to ensure timely response to detected cybersecurity events.
Communications (RS.CO): Response activities are coordinated with internal and external stakeholders, as appropriate, to include external support from law enforcement agencies.
Analysis (RS.AN): Analysis is conducted to ensure adequate response and support recovery activities.
Mitigation (RS.MI): Activities are performed to prevent expansion of an event, mitigate its effects, and eradicate the incident.
Improvements (RS.IM): Organizational response activities are improved by incorporating lessons learned from current and previous detection/response activities.


=== Recover ===
"Develop and implement the appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident."

Recovery Planning (RC.RP): Recovery processes and procedures are executed and maintained to ensure timely restoration of systems or assets affected by cybersecurity events.
Improvements (RC.IM): Recovery planning and processes are improved by incorporating lessons learned into future activities.
Communications (RC.CO): Restoration activities are coordinated with internal and external parties, such as coordinating centers, Internet Service Providers, owners of attacking systems, victims, other CSIRTs, and vendors.


== Updates ==
In 2021 NIST released Security Measures for "EO-Critical Software" Use Under Executive Order (EO) 14028 to outline security measures intended to better protect the use of deployed EO-critical software in agencies’ operational environments.


=== Journey to CSF 2.0 ===
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is meant to be a living document, meaning it will be updated and improved over time to keep up with changes in technology and cybersecurity threats, as well as to integrate best-practices and lessons learned. Since releasing version 1.1 in 2018, stakeholders have provided feedback that the CSF needed to be updated. In February 2022, NIST released a request for information on ways to improve the CSF, and released a subsequent concept paper in January of 2023 with proposed changes. Most recently, NIST released its Discussion Draft: The NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 Core with Implementation Examples and has requested public comments be submitted by November 4, 2023. 


==== Main Changes ====
The following is a list of the major changes to the framework from version 1.1 to 2.0:

The title of the framework has changed from "Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity" to "Cybersecurity Framework". The scope of the framework has been updated to reflect the large population of organizations that use the framework.
Implementation examples have been added to provide practical and action-oriented processes to help users achieve the CSF subcategories. Additionally, the framework Profiles have been revised and expanded to demonstrate the various purposes of the profiles.
A new Function, Govern, has been added to provide organizational context and the roles and responsibilities associated with developing a cybersecurity governance model. There is also an additional category in this Function focused on cybersecurity supply chain risk management.
The latest update also provides greater information on cybersecurity assessments by placing greater importance on the continuous improvement of security through a new Improvement Category in the Identify Function.
