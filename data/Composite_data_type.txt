In computer science, a composite data type or compound data type is a data type that consists of programming language scalar data types and other composite types that may be heterogeneous and hierarchical in nature. It is sometimes called a structure or by a language-specific keyword used to define one such as struct. It falls into the aggregate type classification which includes homogenous collections such as the array and list.
