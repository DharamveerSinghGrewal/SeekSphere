Artificial intelligence (AI) has many applications in warfare, including in communications, intelligence, and munitions control.


== Uses ==
AI can enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams.
AI has been used in military operations in Iraq, Syria, Ukraine and Israel.


=== Autonomous armament ===

Military drones capable of autonomous action are in wide use.


=== Command and control ===
In 2024 a Chinese laboratory at the Joint Operations College of the National Defense University in Shijiazhuang has created an AI military commander, for use in large-scale war simulations in the role of the commander-in-chief.
In 2024, the Ukrainian Army developed autonomous Kamikaze drones in order to make Russian interference during flight ineffective.


=== Military intelligence ===
In 2023, the United States Department of Defense tested generative AI based on large language models to digitize and integrate data across the military.
In the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Israel used two AI systems to generate targets to strike: Habsora (translated: "the gospel") was used to compile a list of buildings to target, while "Lavender" produced a list of people. "Lavender" produced a list of 37,000 people to target. The list of buildings to target included Gazan private homes of people that were suspected of affiliation to Hamas operatives. The combination of AI targeting technology with policy shift away from avoiding civilian targets resulted in unprecedented numbers of civilian deaths. IDF officials say the program addresses the previous issue of the air force running out of targets. Using Habsora, officials say that suspected and junior Hamas members homes significantly expand the "AI target bank." An internal source describes the process as a “mass assassination factory”.
In 2024, the U.S. military trained artificial intelligence to identify airstrike targets during its operations in Iraq and Syria.


== Global trends ==
Various countries are researching and deploying AI military applications, in what has been termed the "artificial intelligence arms race". Ongoing research is focused on intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles.
Worldwide annual military spending on robotics rose from US$5.1 billion in 2010 to US$7.5 billion in 2015.
In November 2023, US Vice President Kamala Harris disclosed a declaration signed by 31 nations to set guardrails for the military use of AI. The commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military AI with international laws, and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology.
Many AI researchers try to avoid military applications.


== In popular culture ==
Military artificial intelligence systems have appeared in many works of fiction, often as antagonists.


=== Film ===
The Terminator franchise
The Matrix franchise


=== Literature ===
Legends of Dune trilogy by Brian Herbert
