The Bentley Continental GT is a grand touring car manufactured and marketed by the British company Bentley Motors since 2003. A two-door coupé or convertible, and has four seats, it was the first new Bentley released after the company's acquisition by Volkswagen AG in 1998, and the first Bentley to employ mass production manufacturing techniques. It was later joined by the Bentley Continental Flying Spur, a four-door saloon car variant.


== Origin ==
In 1994, Rolls-Royce Motors who at that time owned the Bentley brand, previewed a convertible concept car at the Geneva Motor Show – the Concept Java. The car was designed to be a smaller, more affordable Bentley, yet still exclusive in order to maintain the integrity of the brand. It was to appeal to a new range of potential buyers and generate increase sales volume for Rolls-Royce. At the time the current Bentley Continental R was an ultra-exclusive £180,000 in the UK, within reach of a very select market, selling only 200–300 units a year. The Concept Java never went into production in the form seen in 1994, although 13 cars were made for the Sultan of Brunei. However, the Bentley Continental GT realised the concept of the Java as a more affordable Bentley, manufactured in much larger volumes.


== First generation (2003–2011) ==


=== Continental GT (2003–2011) ===

The vehicle debuted in 2002 at the Paris Motor Show, followed by Le Mans, the 2003 Goodwood Festival of Speed and the 2003 annual Bentley Drivers Club meeting at Silverstone. The car differed from the previous Continental R & T models in terms of its concept: although much of the car is hand assembled, it is a mass-produced car made in significantly larger numbers. It is not a coach-built car. The price at launch was less than half the price of the Continental R, giving the car a wider customer base.
The Continental GT is equipped with a 6.0 litre twin-turbocharged W12 engine, which produces a DIN-rated power output of 560 PS (412 kW; 552 bhp) at 6,100 rpm, and torque of 650 N⋅m (479 lbf⋅ft) at 1,600–6,100 rpm. A Torsen-based permanent four-wheel drive is standard. It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0.0 to 62.1 mph) in 4.8 seconds, and go on to reach a top speed of 318 km/h (197.6 mph).
Early models include a choice of 6 body colours (Diamond Black, Burnt Oak, Cypress, Neptune, Spruce, and Umbrian Red), 8 hide colours (Beluga, Burnt Oak, Laurel, Nautic, Portland, Saffron, Savannah, Saddle), 5 veneer types (Burr Oak, Burr Walnut, Dark Stained Walnut, Madrona, Piano Black) and 4 carpet and seatbelt colours (Beluga, Burnt Oak, Laurel, Nautic). The dashboard clock was made by Swiss luxury watchmaker Breitling.

The first Bentley capable of running on both motor spirit and biofuel (E85 ethanol), its 6.0 litre W12 engine is rated at 630 PS (463 kW; 621 bhp) at 6,000 rpm and 800 N⋅m (590 lbf⋅ft) at 1,700–5,600 rpm – using either fuel.

The Continental GT is the first production car ever to have an entire body side made from the Super Formed process; a precision technique with aluminium which allows more complex, sharply defined body lines. Unlike prior models, the panels are "superformed" with heated aluminium sheets molded by gas instead of a stamp. Manufacturer's figures indicate 0–60 mph takes 3.6 seconds (3.7 seconds 0–100 km/h) and it is capable of reaching a top speed of 333 km/h (207 mph). The W12 engine – designed, developed, and handbuilt in Crewe – is a further enhanced version of the TSI engine launched in the Bentayga in 2016. Featuring high- and low- pressure direct fuel injection, a variable displacement system, stop-start technology and launch mode, the powertrain produces 635 PS (626 hp) and 900 N⋅m (664 lb⋅ft) of torque.


=== Continental GT/GTC V8 (2019–2024) ===

The Continental GT Mulliner is a luxury version of the Continental GT V8 which's interior features have been handcrafted. The car has the Mulliner driving Specification and the Mulliner interior features. This car has a V8 engine identical to the Bentley Continental GT V8 and has the same capabilities. This car also has a Convertible version known as the GTC Mulliner with the same configurations as all the other models have.


=== Continental GT/GTC Speed (2021–2024) ===

The Bentley Continental GT speed is a car powered by a W12 engine as the Continental GT which enables it to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 3.5 seconds and reach a maximum speed of 208 mph (335 km/h). It also has a maximum torque of 900 N⋅m (664 lb⋅ft) and a maximum power of 659 PS (650 bhp). The interior features sporty seats and the new Bentley rotating screen.

== Fourth generation (2024–present) ==


=== Continental GT/GTC Speed (2024–) ===

The press release for the 2025 Continental GT was made on 25 June 2024, following several weeks of media previews with the model's prototype. The fourth generation Continental was introduced with the top range Speed specification which made its public debut at the 2024 Goodwood Festival of Speed.
The fourth generation GT Speed is powered by a twin-turbo Ultra Performance Hybrid V8 engine, replacing the outgoing W12 engine which ceased production in mid-2024. Capable of generating a maximum power of 782 PS (771 bhp) and a maximum torque of 1,000 N⋅m (738 lb⋅ft), the new hybrid engine enables the car to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 3.2 seconds. Retaining the exterior look and the Porsche Panamera platform of the third generation Continental GT, the fourth generation model has been slightly restyled with features adopted from the Bentley Mulliner Bacalar and Mulliner Batur concept cars. This includes the introduction of new headlights, making the model the first Bentley to have a single-headlight setup since the 1959 Bentley S2. At 2,459 kilograms (5,421 lb), the car is also heavier than the third generation model; this owes to the 25.9kWh battery mounted behind the rear axle which contributes to the fourth generation's 49:51 weight distribution. Manufacturer figures indicate an electric-only range of 81 kilometres (50 mi) from the plug-in battery alone.

=== First generation (2003–2011) ===
In early 2007, a Bentley Continental GT Speed equipped with Nokian Hakkapeliitta Sport Utility 5 studded winter tyres and driven by four-time World Rally Champion Juha Kankkunen, broke the World Speed Record on Ice – on the frozen Baltic Sea near Oulu, Finland. It averaged 321.6 km/h (199.83 mph) in both directions on the "flying kilometre", reaching a maximum speed of 331 km/h (205.67 mph). The previous record was 296 km/h (183.9 mph), achieved with a Bugatti EB110 Supersport. The record-breaking Bentley was largely standard except for a roll-cage, aerodynamic improvements, low-temperature fuel and calibration.
In February 2011, Bentley succeeded in breaking their own land-ice speed record previously set by the Continental GT. They managed to bring a slightly modified Supersports Convertible to 205.48 MPH in Finland, verified by Guinness World Records.
On 15 February 2011 Kankkunen broke the record again, reaching an average speed of 331 km/h (205.67 mph) in a convertible Bentley Continental Supersports. Bentley announced that a limited edition of the car would be released to celebrate the achievement. It seems that Bentley provoked the former tyre supplier by attempting a new record with a different brand (using Pirelli Sotto Zero IIs) because, on 6 March 2011, Nokian Tyres test driver, piloting an Audi RS6 with Nokian Hakkapeliitta 7 studded tyres, took the ice speed record in Finland, clocking a top speed of 206.05 mph (331.61 km/h) in freezing conditions.
