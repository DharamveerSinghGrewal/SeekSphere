Artificial intelligence in architecture describes the use of artificial intelligence in automation, design and planning in the architectural process or in assisting human skills in the field of architecture. Artificial Intelligence is thought to potentially lead to and ensue major changes in architecture.  
AI's potential in optimization of design, planning and productivity have been noted as accelerators in the field of architectural work. The ability of AI to potentially amplify an architect's design process has also been noted. Fears of the replacement of aspects or core processes of the architectural profession by Artificial Intelligence have also been raised, as well as the philosophical implications on the profession and creativity.


== Implications ==


=== Benefits ===
Artificial intelligence, according to ArchDaily, is said to potentially significantly augment the Architectural profession though its ability to improve the design and planning process as well as increasing productivity. Through its ability to handle a large amount of data, AI are said to potentially allow architects a range of design choices with criteria considerations such as budget, requirements adjusted to space, and sustainability goals calculated as part of the design process. ArchDaily said this may allow the design of optimized alternatives that can then undergo human review. AI tools are also said to potentially allow architects to assimilate urban and environmental data to inform their designs, streamlining initial stages of project planning and increasing efficiency and productivity.
The advances in generative design through the input of specific prompts allow architects to produce visual designs, including photorealistic images, and thus render and explore various material choices and spatial configurations. ArchDaily noted this could speed the creative process as well as allow for experimentation and sophistication in the design. Additionally, AI's capacity for pattern recognition and coding could aid architects in organizing design resources and developing custom applications, thus enhancing the efficiency and the collaboration between both architects and AI.
AI is thought to also be able to contribute to the sustainability of buildings by analyzing various factors and following which recommend energy-efficient modifications, thus pushing the industry towards greener practices. The use of AI in building maintenance, project management, and the creation of immersive virtual reality experiences are also thought as potentially augmenting the architectural design process and workflow.
Examples include the use of text-to-image systems such as Midjourney to create detailed architectural images, and the use of AI optimization systems from companies such as Finch3D and Autodesk to automatically generate floor plans from simple programmatic inputs.
Architect Kudless in an interview to Dezeen recounted that he uses AI to innovate in architectural design by incorporating materials and scenes not usually present in initial plans, which he believes can significantly alter client presentations. He told Dezeen he believes one should show clients renderings from the onset, with AI assisting in this work, arguing that changes in design should be a positive aspect of the client-designer relationship by actively involving clients in the process. Additionally, Kudless highlighted the AI's potential to facilitate labor in architectural firms, particularly in automating rendering tasks, thus reducing the workload on junior staff while maintaining control over the creative output.


=== Emergent aesthetics ===
In an interview for the AItopia series to Dezeen, designer Tim Fu discussed the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in architecture, there he proposed a future where AI could herald a "neoclassical futurist" style, blending the grandeur of classical aesthetics with futuristic design. Through his collaborative project, The AI Stone Carver, Fu showcased how AI can innovate traditional practices by generating design concepts that are then realized through human craftsmanship, such as stone carving by mason Till Apfel. This approach he believed celebrated the fusion of diverse architectural styles and also emphasized the unique capabilities of AI in enhancing creative design processes.
Fu told Dezeen he envisions the integration of AI in design as a means to revive the ornamentation and detailed aesthetics characteristic of classical architecture, moving away from the minimalism, which he said dominates contemporary architecture He argued that AI's involvement in the ideation phase of design allows for a reversal in the roles of machine and human, enabling architects and designers to focus on creating more intricate and ornamental structures. Fu's optimistic outlook extended to the broader impact of AI on the architectural field, seeing it as an indispensable tool that will shift rather than replace human roles, enriching the field with innovative designs that pay homage to the beauty and qualities of classical architecture not present in contemporary architecture while embracing new technologies.


=== Concerns ===
As artificial intelligence continues to expand its presence across various industries, its impact on the architectural profession has become a topic of growing discussion. These discussions focus on how AI processes may influence traditional architectural practices, potentially altering job roles, and shaping the nature of creativity. While AI-driven processes may increase efficiency in some aspects of the profession, it also raises questions about the potential loss of unique design perspectives. These thoughts have been countered by many prominent creative figures in the realm of AI Architecture such as Stephen Coorlas, Tim Fu and Hassan Ragab, who have showcased the amplification of creativity in design and potential benefits in terms of restoring creative power to the designer.

One concern is that AI-powered tools may reduce the demand for human input in certain tasks. There is speculation that this may result in a shift toward managerial or supervisory roles for architects.
In some design scenarios, algorithmically generated solutions can be adjusted to prioritize efficiency and cost-effectiveness, which some argue may overshadow the creative and contextual nuances that define individual architectural styles. As with any discipline though, it has been determined that AI can be configured to provide beneficial results based on inputs and end goals the architect or designer assigns it.  
There are also concerns about the potential for AI to exacerbate inequalities within the architectural profession. For instance, larger firms with greater resources to invest in advanced AI technologies may gain a competitive edge over smaller firms and independent architects. This dynamic could contribute to industry consolidation, potentially limiting the diversity of architectural practice and stifling innovation. Ethical considerations in regard to cultural sensitivity have also been raised due to the datasets used to train AI. Without proper vetting of data or implementing failsafe overrides, AI generated outcomes can trend toward overly documented and prioritized content.
