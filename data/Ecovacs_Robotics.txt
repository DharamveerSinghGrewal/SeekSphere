In 1998, Qian Dongqi founded Ecovacs Robotics as an original equipment manufacturer for vacuum cleaners under the name TEK Electrical Company. The company rebranded in late 2006 as an independent manufacturer of robotic devices for home cleaning. By 2007, Ecovacs Robotics had introduced its floor cleaning Deebot series. The product was featured and had a recurring role on Real World: Skeletons in 2015.
From 2012 to 2014, Ecovacs Robotics expanded its operations with offices in the United States, Germany and Japan. The company also introduced products for mobile entertainment and security, air purification and window cleaning. Ecovacs Robotics collaborated and partnered with Marvel Entertainment for limited edition themed Deebots to coincide with the release of Captain America: Civil War.
At the 32nd DEF CON security conference, researchers presented documentation on significant vulnerabilities within Ecovac products, including the ability to remotely and silently record users within their homes by abusing unsecured Bluetooth connections. Ecovac did not acknowledge the report prior to publication by the researchers however, in a statement issued after the conference, Ecovac indicated that they would not issue software fixes for the associated vulnerabilities.
