A practical quantum computer must use a physical system as a programmable quantum register. Researchers are exploring several technologies as candidates for reliable qubit implementations.

Superconducting quantum computing (qubit implemented by the state of nonlinear resonant superconducting circuits containing Josephson junctions)
Trapped ion quantum computer (qubit implemented by the internal state of trapped ions)
Neutral atom quantum computer (qubit implemented by internal states of neutral atoms trapped in an optical lattice or an array of dipole traps, i.e. optical tweezers)
Quantum dot computer, spin-based (e.g. the Loss-DiVincenzo quantum computer) (qubit given by the spin states of trapped electrons)
Quantum dot computer, spatial-based (qubit given by electron position in double quantum dot)
Quantum computing using engineered quantum wells, which could in principle enable the construction of a quantum computer that operates at room temperature
Coupled quantum wire (qubit implemented by a pair of quantum wires coupled by a quantum point contact)
Nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer (NMRQC) implemented with the nuclear magnetic resonance of molecules in solution, where qubits are provided by nuclear spins within the dissolved molecule and probed with radio waves
