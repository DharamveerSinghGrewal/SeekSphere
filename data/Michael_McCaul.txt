=== Elections ===
McCaul first ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004 and won a crowded Republican primary in the newly created 10th District. The district, which included part of Austin, the western part of Harris County and several rural counties in between, was thought to be so heavily Republican that no Democratic candidate even filed, effectively handing him the seat.
In 2006 he defeated Democratic nominee Ted Ankrum and former Libertarian presidential candidate Michael Badnarik with 55% of the vote. McCaul was reelected again in 2008, against Democratic candidate Larry Joe Doherty and Libertarian candidate Matt Finkel, 54% to 43%.
Four years later, he was reelected to a fourth term with 76% of the vote against Ankrum (22%) and Libertarian candidate Jeremiah "JP" Perkins (1%). McCaul won a seventh term in 2016 with 179,221 votes (57.3%) to Democratic nominee Tawana W. Cadien's 120,170 (38.4%). Libertarian Bill Kelsey received 13,209 (4.2%).
In 2018, McCaul won an eighth term in the House with 157,166 votes (51.1%) to Democratic nominee Mike Siegel's 144,034 (46.8%) and Libertarian Mike Ryan's 6,627 votes (2.5%). It was the closest race of McCaul's career.
He was elected to a ninth term in 2020, defeating Siegel again.


=== Political positions ===


==== Cybersecurity ====

On December 11, 2013, McCaul introduced legislation to require the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct cybersecurity activities on behalf of the federal government and codify DHS's role in preventing and responding to cybersecurity incidents involving the information technology (IT) systems of federal civilian agencies and critical infrastructure in the U.S. McCaul said the bill was "an important step toward addressing the cyber threat."


==== Donald Trump ====
On December 18, 2019, McCaul voted against both articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. Of the 195 Republicans who voted, all voted against both impeachment articles. He also voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the January 6 attack encouraged by Trump's false claims of electoral fraud. However, unlike Trump and most Republican legislators, McCaul did not sign the Texas v. Pennsylvania amicus brief to file a motion in support of the case. 


==== Foreign affairs ====
In April 2019, McCaul spoke out against a resolution that would end U.S. involvement in the Yemeni Civil War, saying it would "disrupt US security cooperation agreements with more than 100 countries."
In 2021, McCaul strongly supported President Joe Biden's airstrikes on Iranian targets in Syria.
McCaul said he supports heavily arming Ukraine with the weapons they need to win the Russo-Ukrainian War. He believes the United States should send fighter jets and more missiles to Ukraine. In February 2023, McCaul met the President of Ukraine in Kyiv and advocated for the United States to send more military aid to Ukraine, especially ATACMS.
In April 2023, during a meeting with Taiwanese officials, McCaul compared Chinese President Xi Jinping to Hitler.
On April 23, 2023, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced sanctions over McCaul, alleging his frequent interference in China's "internal affairs." In 2024, McCaul was targeted by the Chinese government's Spamouflage influence operation.
In November 2024, McCaul announced he was stepping down as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.


==== Immigration ====
McCaul supported President Donald Trump's proposals to build a wall along the Mexicoâ€“United States border. He supports the Remain in Mexico policy.


==== TikTok ====
Around the time of the introduction of Protecting Americans' Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries, the act including the TikTok ban, McCaul received attention for purchasing stock in Meta.


==== Taliban Funding ====
Shawn Ryan requested McCaul to introduce legislature ending the alleged funding of the Taliban by the U.S. government in 2024. Shawn Ryan later told Donald Trump in a interview that McCaul had "done nothing".

In 2011, Roll Call named McCaul as one of the wealthiest members of the United States Congress, surpassing then U.S. senator John Kerry. His net worth was estimated at $294 million, up from $74 million the previous year. In 2004, the same publication estimated his net worth at $12 million. His wealth increase was due to large monetary transfers from his wife's family.
McCaul and his family live in West Lake Hills, Texas, a wealthy suburb of Austin, Texas.
McCaul is a devout Catholic and is a noted critic of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega due to Ortega's stance against the Catholic Church in Nicaragua.

McCaul was briefly detained at Dulles International Airport, explaining to police he had drunk alcohol after taking Ambien. A family member arrived to drive him to his destination, and McCaul expressed gratitude for law enforcement, while emphasizing his commitment to learn from the mistake.
