The NATO Software Engineering Conferences were held in 1968 and 1969. The conferences were attended by international experts on computer software who aimed to define best practices for software development grounded in the application of engineering principles. The result of the conferences were two reports, one for the 1968 conference and the other for the 1969 conference, that outlined how software should be developed. The conferences played a major role in gaining general acceptance for the term software engineering.


== Background ==
In the 1960s, the computer industry was experiencing rapid growth, leading to increasing complexity in software development. This period saw the emergence of what was later termed the "software crisis", characterized by projects that were over budget, overdue, and unreliable. To address these challenges, the NATO Science Committee convened two conferences to explore ways to improve software development practices by applying engineering principles.


== 1968 Conference in Garmisch ==
The first conference took place in Garmisch, Germany, from 7 to 11 October 1968. It was attended by 50 leading computer scientists and practitioners from 11 countries, including Edsger Dijkstra, Friedrich L. Bauer, Alan Perlis, and Peter Naur. The term "software engineering" was deliberately chosen as the conference title to provoke thought regarding the need for disciplined approaches in software development.
During the conference, participants discussed issues such as software reliability, project management, and the challenges of large-scale software systems. The concept of the "software crisis" was a central theme, highlighting the difficulties in producing high-quality software on time and within budget. The conference emphasized the importance of adopting engineering principles in software development to improve reliability and efficiency.
The conference resulted in a report edited by Peter Naur and Brian Randell, which compiled the discussions and recommendations made during the event. The editors faced the challenge of capturing the dynamic discussions and diverse viewpoints, ultimately producing a document that emphasized the need for formal methodologies and better project management in software development.


== 1969 Conference in Rome ==
Following the success of the first conference, a second conference was held in Rome, Italy, from 27 to 31 October 1969. The goal was to delve deeper into the technical aspects of software engineering. However, the atmosphere differed from the first conference, with less consensus among participants and a lack of clear direction.
Discussions at the Rome conference focused on software design techniques, methodologies, and tools. The conference highlighted the communication gap between different groups involved in software development, emphasizing the need for better collaboration. There was also a proposal to establish an international software engineering institute, but it did not gain sufficient support. Additionally, the conference brought to light the differing opinions on how software engineering should evolve, with debates over the balance between theoretical approaches and practical applications.
The report from the second conference was edited by John Buxton and Brian Randell. The editors faced challenges due to the lack of clear consensus among participants, making the compilation of the report more difficult than the previous year. Despite these difficulties, the report provided insights into the state of software engineering at the time and highlighted areas needing further research and development.


== Impact and legacy ==
The NATO Software Engineering Conferences were instrumental in establishing software engineering as a recognized discipline. The conferences popularized the term "software engineering" and brought attention to the critical issues facing the software industry at the time.
The reports from these conferences influenced academia and industry, leading to the development of new methodologies, tools, and educational programs. They prompted further discussions on software reliability, project management, and the application of engineering principles to software development. The conferences are considered seminal events in the history of software engineering, setting the foundation for the discipline and inspiring future conferences and research in the field.
