A data processing unit (DPU) is a programmable computer processor that tightly integrates a general-purpose CPU with network interface hardware. Sometimes they are called "IPUs" (for "infrastructure processing unit") or "SmartNICs". They can be used in place of traditional NICs to relieve the main CPU of complex networking responsibilities and other "infrastructural" duties; although their features vary, they may be used to perform encryption/decryption, serve as a firewall, handle TCP/IP, process HTTP requests, or even function as a hypervisor or storage controller. These devices can be attractive to cloud computing providers whose servers might otherwise spend a significant amount of CPU time on these tasks, cutting into the cycles they can provide to guests. 


== Examples of DPUs ==


=== Azure Boost DPU ===
In 2024, Microsoft introduced the Azure Boost DPU, a custom-designed data processing unit aimed at optimizing network and infrastructure efficiency across its Azure cloud platform. This DPU offloads network-related tasks such as packet processing, security enforcement, and traffic management from central CPUs, enabling better performance for application workloads.


==== Key Features ====
Network Optimization: The Azure Boost DPU enhances network throughput and reduces latency by processing data packets and offloading these tasks from traditional CPUs.
Security Capabilities: It integrates advanced isolation techniques to secure multi-tenant environments, protecting sensitive workloads.
Hyperscale Adaptability: Designed for large-scale data centers, the DPU supports Azure’s hyperscale infrastructure, ensuring scalability for modern cloud applications.


==== Industry Context ====
The Azure Boost DPU aligns with the trend of custom silicon development in hyperscale cloud environments. Similar to AWS’s Nitro System and NVIDIA’s BlueField DPUs, Microsoft’s DPU focuses on enhancing cloud efficiency while addressing rising energy and security demands. This innovation positions Microsoft alongside other cloud leaders leveraging DPUs to optimize data center operations and provide cost-effective, high-performance solutions for customers.


== Impact on Cloud Computing ==
The introduction of DPUs like Azure Boost reflects a broader shift in the cloud computing industry toward offloading specific functions from general-purpose processors to specialized hardware. Microsoft’s Azure Boost DPU represents its strategy to reduce costs, enhance security, and achieve sustainability goals while improving infrastructure efficiency.
